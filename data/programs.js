    fullDescription: `
    Hello, my name is Abed, and I’m from Gaza.

    I’m a husband and a father to a young son. Like many families here, our lives have been devastated by the crisis. I lost my job due to the conflict and have been displaced multiple times. We are currently struggling just to afford the basics — even simple things like bread, vegetables, and clean water have become luxuries.

    The cost of living is now unbearable. A single bag of flour costs nearly $300 — something we used to buy for a fraction of that. Most vegetables are sold at prices far beyond what any ordinary person can afford. My wife and I do everything we can to provide for our son, but the reality is harsh: without outside help, survival is becoming impossible.

    This campaign is not for anything extra — it’s to help cover daily life essentials:

    Food and clean water
    Basic hygiene items
    Rent or temporary shelter
    Anything that helps keep my child safe and fed

    We live with constant uncertainty, but your support can give us a little relief and a sense of hope. Whether it’s a donation or simply sharing this campaign, every act of kindness counts.

    Thank you for reading, and thank you for standing with us.

    With all my heart,
    Abed and the entire family`,

      A Life Once Filled with Joy
Mohammed lived peacefully with his family in Gaza.

His children were full of life—playing, laughing, and dreaming.

He raised birds, which symbolized hope, peace, and healing amid war.

The Day Everything Changed
A bombing flattened his home.

All three children died—one after the other—in front of him.

His wife also perished.

Mohammed was left alone, homeless, and traumatized.

Why This Fundraiser Matters
Mohammed wants to rebuild his life, but he can’t do it alone. He needs:

 Shelter and food

 Support to restart his bird-keeping business

 Mental health and trauma support

 Hope from people who care

How You Can Help
Every donation, no matter how small, brings Mohammed closer to healing. He’s not asking for luxury—just a chance to survive, rebuild, and live again.

    title: 'Help My Family from Gaza Find Hope',
    shortDescription: 'Our lives have been shattered—not just by the loss of our home, but by the very erosion of the security we once knew Every day, we grapple with the grim realities of displacement and constant danger.',
    fullDescription: `
    My name is Reem, a Palestinian from Gaza, and I’m doing everything I can to get my family to safety.

My family includes:

Kamal (father, 62) – suffers from high blood pressure & diabetes

Summer (mother, 51) – frail and in poor health

Sahar (24), Malak (21), and Mohammed (8)

Why We're Asking for Help
Our home has been destroyed, and we now face displacement, danger, hunger, and medical crises.
We live without basic necessities—no clean water, no food, no shelter, and no access to healthcare.

My parents’ health is rapidly declining without proper treatment.

We sleep in the cold, under constant fear and uncertainty.

We’ve lost everything—except hope.

What We Need
Your support will help us:

 Secure temporary shelter

 Access clean water and food

 Afford urgent medical care for our parents

 Rebuild our lives, step by step

How You Can Help
Please consider:

Donating anything you can

Sharing our story to reach others

Every dollar and act of kindness is a lifeline for us. This is more than charity—it’s a chance at survival.

“Your support truly means everything. In our darkest hour, you can be the light we desperately need.” – Reem
