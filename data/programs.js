    Hello, my name is Abed, and I’m from Gaza.

    I’m a husband and a father to a young son. Like many families here, our lives have been devastated by the crisis. I lost my job due to the conflict and have been displaced multiple times. We are currently struggling just to afford the basics — even simple things like bread, vegetables, and clean water have become luxuries.

    The cost of living is now unbearable. A single bag of flour costs nearly $300 — something we used to buy for a fraction of that. Most vegetables are sold at prices far beyond what any ordinary person can afford. My wife and I do everything we can to provide for our son, but the reality is harsh: without outside help, survival is becoming impossible.

    This campaign is not for anything extra — it’s to help cover daily life essentials:

    Food and clean water
    Basic hygiene items
    Rent or temporary shelter
    Anything that helps keep my child safe and fed

    We live with constant uncertainty, but your support can give us a little relief and a sense of hope. Whether it’s a donation or simply sharing this campaign, every act of kindness counts.

    Thank you for reading, and thank you for standing with us.

    With all my heart,
    Abed and the entire family`,

      Cry of the Sole Survivor – A Father Who Lost His Entire Family and Everything Under the Rubble

     This fundraiser will help a grieving father, the sole survivor of his family, rebuild his life after losing his wife, children, and home under the rubble.

     "Shadow of Hope Under the Rubble" –Mohammed AlSalool, Gaza
     The Innocent Dream

      In those days when life was simpler, my heart was full of peace. I lived with my small family in our modest home in Gaza, where Hamza, the eldest son, was eight years old and dreamed of new toys and schools to attend. My middle son, Musab, who was only six, used to chase his older brother around, laughing and playing together. And then there was Meshal, our youngest, who was just six months old, filling our home with his innocent laughter that calmed his mother’s heart, despite the cruelty of war. I lived with them, working in bird-keeping, which was not just a job, but a symbol of hope and comfort in a world filled with challenges.

        A Father’s Care for the Birds ️

      I always believed that the birds were a symbol of life. I cared for them as if they were my children, seeing them as a source of peace for a broken heart in a time filled with pain. The birds were my small escape from the harsh reality we faced. I lived to see them fly freely, reminding me that there’s always hope for life, despite the destruction.

The Moment of Fate ⚡

Then came that day, the one I’ll never forget. The first sound of the bombing was enough to rip everything from our lives. Our house was destroyed, and everything we held dear turned into rubble. In that moment, I knew I had lost everything… my home, my family, my dreams. There was nothing left but the rubble beneath my feet and the tears that washed my face.

Losing My Loved Ones

In the midst of the bombing, Hamza, my eldest son, was martyred instantly. I saw the dream in his eyes, and in a single moment, that dream became nothing but a memory. Musab, my middle child, followed him an hour later after the medical efforts. We tried to save him, but his small body couldn't endure. As for Meshal, my tiny six-month-old, he reached the hospital in critical condition, and the medics tried with all their might to save him, but even his tiny heart couldn't handle the strain. They all left us in an instant. Everything stopped.

The Final Farewell

That scene in the hospital is one I can never forget. The hands that tried so hard to bring Meshal back to life trembled, and I stood helpless, unable to do anything but watch. I had nothing but tears, but those tears were of no use. Meshal, despite all our attempts, left us, and I lost everything. Everything ended in a single moment.
Amid the Rubble ️

Today, I am alone, surrounded by the rubble of the life I once had. I’ve lost my wife, my children, and everything that gave me strength to live. Now, I live in a world that only holds destruction. But despite the deep pain, I won’t give up. I will continue to search for hope, even if it’s in the smallest things. I want to start again, but I can't do it alone.

Hope Amidst Destruction

Today, after everything I’ve been through, I’ve realized that life doesn’t stop. Yes, I’ve lost everything, but I can’t live in this sorrow forever. I want to start again. I want to raise birds once more because they are the hope I see in front of me. I want to live again, and I want to have a life, but I can’t do it alone. I need your help; I need your hands to reach out to me and give me a chance for a new beginning.

Call for Hope and Humanity
Today, I need your help, not just because I’ve lost everything, but because I want to live again, I want to start fresh. Gaza, which has given so much through its sacrifices, is in need of our support now. I need help to rebuild my life and start over.
If you have the ability to donate, to help, to offer hope to someone like me, I ask you with all my pain and sincerity to reach out and assist me.
Every contribution, no matter how small, will make a difference in my life. I need:
• Financial support to cover my basic needs, such as shelter and food.
• Help to restore my bird-keeping business, which is what I live for, and I want to start again.
• Assistance in securing a safe shelter for myself, as I am now homeless.
• Psychological support to help me get through the deep trauma I’m living with.

I want to live and build a new life, but I need you. Every donation, every word of support, every act of kindness will be the hope that brings me back to life. Thank you from the depths of my heart for everything you can offer.

Hello, my name is Reem. I’m a Palestinian from Gaza, and I’m doing everything I can to get my family to safety.

My family includes:
• Kamal (my dad), 62 years old
• Summer (my mom), 51 years old
• Sahar, 24 years old
• Malak, 21 years old
• Mohammed, 8 years old

With a heart burdened by loss and pain, I reach out in desperate hope amid the unimaginable hardships we face in Gaza.
Our lives have been shattered—not just by the loss of our home, but by the very erosion of the security we once knew.
Every day, we grapple with the grim realities of displacement and constant danger.
My once cherished home, a sanctuary of warmth and safety, now lies in ruins under relentless destruction.
The bitter cold of winter and ceaseless rains have made our struggle even more unbearable, pushing us further into despair. Basic necessities—food, clean water, and the simplest forms of shelter—have become distant dreams, out of reach in a world turned hostile.
My father, a man who has long battled high blood pressure and diabetes, and my beloved mother, whose frail health continues to deteriorate, now stand as symbols of our relentless suffering.

Without access to proper medical care or essential medicines, their fragile health hangs by a thread, echoing the collective pain of those who have lost everything. In these dire moments, I implore you to consider extending a lifeline.
Your generous support—whether through a donation or by simply sharing our story—has the power to bring us a glimmer of hope in this abyss of despair.
Every dollar raised through this campaign will go directly toward helping my displaced family in Gaza survive the harsh and deteriorating conditions they are facing. The funds will be used to secure essential needs such as food, clean water, medicine, and temporary shelter.
In addition, we will prioritize critical health support for my parents, whose medical conditions require constant attention and access to treatment.
Every contribution will be handled with transparency and care, ensuring that your support provides real, immediate relief—bringing us one step closer to safety, stability, and the hope of rebuilding what was lost. Your compassion, no matter how modest, is not just charity—it is a beacon of hope and a testament to our shared humanity.
In this battle for survival, every act of kindness brings us closer to reclaiming a sense of normalcy and hope for a better future.
Thank you for taking the time to listen to our plight and for considering any help you can provide during this darkest of times.





From the bottom of my heart, thank you for standing with us in this time of urgent need. Your support truly means everything.Dear world,
